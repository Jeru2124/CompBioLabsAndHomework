*I) About the Data*
_________
**Study Goals**
 This 69.0KB data file compiles averages of morphological sizes of 214 avian species. The average body masses, bill lengths, and digit lengths of each species are enclosed along with values of minimum climate temperatures at the location of the species natural habitat. The study was constructed to illustrate evidence for "Allen's rule" (Symonds & Tattersall, 2010). This evolutionary principle describes the tendency for animals to adapt to cold environments with limited bodily surface areas, maximizing thermoregulation efficiency and minimizing heat loss. 

**Methodology and Format**
Data was obtained via a wide variety of primary sources, external to this study and independently curated. A .xls file, the data is formatted to include the family, genus, and species name, along with the following measurements:  
 > Body mass, Bill length, Tarsus length, Middle Toe length, Tarsometatarsus+middle toe length, Midpoint latitude (degrees from equator), Midpoint altitude, & Minimum temperature at midpoint of range (Celsius)
 
 **Inconsistencies in Data**
 Body mass, minimum temperature at midpoint of species range, and species, genus, family names are the only columns that are complete for this data set. There is data missing in small and large patches for many of the species in all other categories. Otherwise, all data is numerical, not including the organisms taxonomy.

**Repeating Paper Analysis and Expanding**
I plan on assessing a take on the paper's initial question: Does geographical variation in bill size across bird species provide evidence for Allen’s rule? In an effort to utilize the skills we've learned in EBIO4420, I aim to ask: what is the probability distribution of aves that have a certain body size and dwell at a particular regional climate? Because I'm very interested in the topic of phylogeny, I would also like to explore how well body mass and beak size are predictors of phylogeny as a supplementary exploration, if the initial project proves to be to straightforward. 

My analysis will be organized into three parts:

I) Create a value that will allow for simple computation of body proportions (a ratio that couples body mass to bill length that will serve as an indicator of "compactness."

II) Model a simple regression line that describes the correlation between body proportions and regional temperature.

III) Create a probability distribution of body proportions as they relate to the geographical temperature gradient, using the Poisson distribution model. Because the Poisson distribution requires discrete variables, I may likely have to organize the data into benchmarks. If this is not reflective of the data, I will use a continuous probability distribution.
